_&quot;On the 25th, in Madrid, Spain, the ISO C++ committee [approved a Final Draft International Standard (FDIS)](http://herbsutter.com/2011/03/25/we-have-fdis-trip-report-march-2011-c-standards-meeting/)
 for the C++ programming language. This means that the proposed changes 
to the new standard so far known as C++0x are now final. The 
finalization of the standard itself, i.e. updating the working draft and
 transmitting the final draft to [ITTF](http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/supporting_services/information_technology_task_force.htm)
, is due to be completed during the summer, after which the standard is going to be published, to be known as **C++ 2011**
.
 With the previous ISO C++ standard dating back to 2003 and C++0x having
 been for over eight years in development, the  implementation of the 
standard is already well underway in the [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html)
 and [Visual C++](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2010/04/06/c-0x-core-language-features-in-vc10-the-table.aspx)
 compilers. [Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/homepage.html)
, the creator of C++, maintains a handy [FAQ](http://www2.research.att.com/%7Ebs/C++0xFAQ.html)
 of the new standard.&quot;_
